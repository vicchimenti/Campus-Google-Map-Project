# Marcom-Google-Map-Project


20181011
This project is a request from Student Services to create a campus Google Map and link to specific offices that are related to Student Success Services.

There is currently a working map of the campus, however the office coordinates need to be updated and the links need to be tied to the map position. When a link is clicked, the map should center on that office and the pop-up description should hover in the margin and not over the map.

The first commit to this repo is the existing js code from t4. This code will be refactored to include the corrected coordinates and the updated functionality.

Today readability and review was completed for existing code.

TODO:
Friday verify all coordinates
Find out how to link the Keys to the Markers and begin implementation.
Next week convert keys content type to an accordion
Move text box to margin
Get map to center on Markers using click listener
